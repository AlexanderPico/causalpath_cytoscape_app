## Coding Phase
This week is about the full-fledged development of different functionalities of the user interface and start to work on running the causal path algorithm from the app.

## Work Progress

1. **Work on the UI and ADD more components**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Added more functionality into UI components for the Cytoscape App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/9)

2. **Upload SIF and Format File**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Use buttons to import and load these two file for visualization.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/11)

3. **Upload the JSON file from the Local and Parse it**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Using Button to upload the Json file and create custom logic for the parser and successfully read the data from the JSON.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/12)

4. **Run causalpath.jar From Within Cytoscape App**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Import the Maven repository and added the dependency to the pom.xml file. And started to run the algorithm from the app.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/10)


## Conclusion  
This week I got stuck to add button functionalities. Augustin helped me with this and asked to use the Cytocopter repository which is very useful in solving the issue. And also Ozgun helped to get started for running the Casual Path Algorithm.
