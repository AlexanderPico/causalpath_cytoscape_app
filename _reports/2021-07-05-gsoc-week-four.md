## Coding Phase
This week is about the getting input from the format file and applying styles to the network. 

## Work Progress

1. **Create View for the Network file**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Editing the format file and edit a static xml file to add the properties of the from the format file](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/13)

2. **Use Force-Directed Layout for App**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Change the layout algorithm from the current grid layout to forced directed layout algorithm.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/14)


## Conclusion  

This week is all about applying the style to the current network. Although I can read the static XML file from the resource directory and edit it, I am having trouble while saving it 
in the resource directory.
