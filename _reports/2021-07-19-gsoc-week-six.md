## Coding Phase
This week is about exploring enhanced graphics in the Cytoscape and try to apply them programmatically. 

## Work Progress
   
1. **Apply Custom Style to Cytoscape Network**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I am able to change the edge tip color into proper RGB value.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/15)
    
2. **Complex Nodes Visualization in Cytoscape**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Explore enhanced graphics and apply it for the nodes Visualization.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/17)
    
3. **Use enhanced graphics app to Represent Annotation Data on a Node programmatically**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Apply enhanced graphics to each node in the network according to the requirement .](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/18)
    
4. **Programmatically Position enhanced graphics app Images **  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Postion the graphics for each node correctly.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/20)
    

## Conclusion  

This week is to apply enhanced graphics programmatically for the complex node visualization. Augustin has helped me with the Omics Visualizer repo which has the usage of enhanced graphics. And I am also able to apply sample enhanced graphics to the nodes.
