## About Me
I am an undergraduate student, pursuing Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [Jadavpur University](http://jaduniv.edu.in), Kolkata, India. My field of interest is Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. I always try to improve myself by gathering knowledge.

## Community Bonding  
This period of GSoC started after the project announcements. I get to know more about the mentors and community in this period.


## Tasks  
During the community bonding period, I was assigned the following work:

1. **Create Basic Cytoscape App Demo**  
    Status: **In Progress**  
    
    [Source Code](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-app-samples/tree/master/sample-import-visual-style)
    
    I created a basic Cytoscape app which imports a network file and visualizes the network. I did minor changes to the source code. 
    
    **Repository:** [CausalPath Cytoscape App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/tree/main/CausalPath%20Cytoscape%20App)
    
    **Issue:** [Get CausalPath Running](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/2)
    
    **Pull Request:**    
            - [Create Sample App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/pull/4)  

2. **Running the Casual Path Algorithm**  
    Status: **Complete**  
    I need to run the algorithm in my local machine and generate a sample result for the given dataset.
    
    **Issue:** [Get CausalPath Running](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/2)

    **Pull Request:**    
            - [Ran the casual path algorithm successfully and uploading a sample result.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/pull/3)  
     

3. **Cytoscape App development documentation**  
    Status: **In Progress**  
    
    The requirement of Cytoscape app development documentation for understanding the complete workflow of different components in it.  
    
    **Issue:** [Cytoscape Documentation](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/6)


## Conclusion  
It has been a very productive week so far. The mentors are very helpful and friendly. The communication is very smooth and can easily reach out to them for any doubt.
Although I am new to Cytoscape, I had started learning from the beginning of the period. As a whole, I am moving forward and enjoying the period.
