## Coding Phase
This week is about modifying enhanced graphics in the Cytoscape and create a result panel to show selected node's details. 

## Work Progress
   
1. **Create Result Panel to show information about the node**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I am able to create a result panel and show the selected node information.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/23)
    
2. **Complex Nodes Visualization in Cytoscape**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I have applied multiples sites for each node and use a proer algorithm to put them correctly.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/17)
    
3. **Get Selected Node name and show the Details on the Result Panel**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I am able to get the information of the selected node for the user's click  and show them on the result panel.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/22)
    

    

## Conclusion  

This week is to modify the enhanced graphics for the complex node visualization and create a result panel to show the selected node information. Augustin guided me to use the label 
chart for the annotation and Ozgun has given an algorithm to provide the annotation properly for each node.
