## Coding Phase
This week is about testing the app on real data and make some modifications to the visualization and update the result panel. 

## Work Progress
   
1. **Create Result Panel to show information about the node**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Modified the design of the panel.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/23)
    
2. **Complex Nodes Visualization in Cytoscape**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I have applied the logic on the network and work is under progress for the complete visualization.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/17)
    
3. **Implement New Full Visualization with LuminalAB-vs-Basal-like Dataset**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I have completed the applied style for every node and edge except the annotations.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/25)
    
4. **Behavior for Loading Additional Networks into Cytoscape**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [I have created a new view for each network such that a user can visualize any number of networks.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/25)
    

    

## Conclusion  

This week is about testing the app on real data and create multiple views such that users can create multiple visualizations at the same time.
