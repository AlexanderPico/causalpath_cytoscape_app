## Community Bonding  
This period of GSoC started after the project announcements. I get to know the more about the mentors and community in this period.


## Tasks  
During the community bonding period, I was assigned the following work:

1. **Create Basic Cytoscape App Demo**  
    Status: **In Progress**  
    [Source Code](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-app-samples/tree/master/sample-import-visual-style)
    I created a basic cytoscape app which imports a network file and visualizes the network.I did minor changes to source code. 
    **Repository:** [CausalPath Cytoscape App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/tree/main/CausalPath%20Cytoscape%20App)
    **Issue:** [Get CausalPath Running](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/2)
    
    **Pull Request:**    
            - [Create Sample App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/pull/4)  

2. **Running the Casual Path Algorithm**  
    Status: **Complete**  
    I need to run the algorithm in my local machine and generate a sample result for the given dataset.
    
    **Issue:** [Get CausalPath Running](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/2)
    
    [Code provided by Mentor](https://github.com/PathwayAndDataAnalysis/causalpath)
    [Dataset provided by mentor](https://www.biorxiv.org/highwire/filestream/83268/field_highwire_adjunct_files/4/258855-5.zip)
    [Result](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/blob/main/Images/casual_path_output.PNG)
    
    **Pull Request:**    
            - [Ran the casual path algorithm successfully and uploading a sample result.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/pull/3)  
     

3. **Cytoscape App development documentaion**  
    Status: **In Progress**  
    The requirment of Cytoscape app development documentation for understanding the complete workflow of different component of it.     
    **Issue:** [Cytoscape Documentation](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/6)
