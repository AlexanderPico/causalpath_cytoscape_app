## Coding Phase
This week is about the creating the visualization of network and continue working on running the causal path algorithm from the app.

## Work Progress

1. **Create View for the Network file**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Edit the SIF file correctly and visualize the network with a sample style](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/13)

2. **Run causalpath.jar From Within Cytoscape App**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Import the Maven repository and added the dependency to the pom.xml file. And started to run the algorithm from the app.](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/10)


## Conclusion  

This is all about solving the problem of running the casual path algorithm from the Cytoscape which we need to debug more. And also I have successfully created the view for the network and applied a sample style to it.
